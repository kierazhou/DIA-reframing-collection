        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <h2>Target Audiences</h2>
        <p>Primary Audience: DIA Museum Visitors
<p>The 200,000+ people who visit places like the DIA every yearâ€”people walking through African, Asian, European, American, Contemporary, Indigenous, 
    Oceanic, and Islamic art galleries who want to understand the fuller story behind what they're seeing.</p>
<p>Art enthusiasts and curious minds who want to connect artworks to bigger historical, social, and cultural contexts
    not just the traditional Western-focused narratives museums have historically told.
<p>From middle schoolers to university students on class trips who need information that meets them where they are
    whether they're just starting to learn about a culture or digging deep into research.</p>
<p>/African American, Asian American, Latino/a, Indigenous, Arab American, and other communities 
    looking for authentic representations of their own cultural heritage when they walk through museum doors.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Data, Information and Content</h2>
        <p><strong>How We Show What We Know (And What We're Still Learning)</strong></p>
<p>We use a color-coded system to be transparent about our curatorial process:</p>
<ul>Blue: Basic information to understand the object</ul>
<ul>Green: Objects with interesting geographic stories or migration histories</ul>
<ul>Orange: Objects with mixed cultural backgrounds or cross-cultural influences</ul>
<ul>Red: We're actively rethinking how we frame these objects</ul>
<ul>Yellow: Waiting on input from cultural experts or community members</ul>

<p><strong>The Tech Side</strong></p>
<p>We're using tools that are either free or low-cost for educational and cultural institutions:</p>
<ul>For Creating 3D Models: Reality Capture (free for schools) and Maya (about $235/year for education, sometimes free through universities)</ul>
<ul>For Displaying Objects: Sketchfab (free for museums) and MetaAR for the AR experience</ul>
<ul>For Mapping Connections: Cytoscape (free and open-source)</ul>
<p>The Platform: A website that works on any device, with cloud storage that can grow as we add more institutions
People just visit reframingcollections.org on any browser and everything works and no app downloads or special software needed.</p>

<p><strong>What It Costs</strong></p>
<ul>Most of the software we're using is free for educational and cultural institutions. The real costs are people's time and cloud hosting.
Starting Small (1-2 museums, 50-100 objects): $15,000-30,000
A part-time team working with a couple of partner institutions to prove the concept works.</ul>
