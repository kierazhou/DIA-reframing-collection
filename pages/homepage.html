        <h1>Reframing Collections: From Geographic Generalizations to Cultural Context</h1>
        <p>（TBD）Reframing Collections addresses a critical gap in how museums present and contextualize their
            collections. Currently, institutions like the Detroit Institute of Arts organize diverse cultural artifacts
            under broad geographic categories such as "Asian Art," which homogenizes distinct cultures, materials, time
            periods, and artistic traditions. This approach removes objects from their specific cultural contexts and
            reinforces problematic generalizations.
            Our project creates a digital tool that enables museums to present their collections through
            culturally-situated networks that include geographic connections alongside cultural context. Rather than
            relying solely on broad regional categories like "Asian Art," we connect objects based on materials, themes,
            techniques, cultural practices, AND meaningful geographic relationships, which should provide visitors with
            a more nuanced and respectful understanding of artistic traditions that honors both cultural specificity and
            geographic heritage. This intervention is both educationally significant and serves anti-racist museum
            practices by moving away from orientalist categorization systems.
            This project addresses the urgent need for museums to decolonize their curatorial practices while providing
            practical implementation guidance for institutional change.</p>
        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <p>(TBD)We are creating an interactive web-based platform and mobile app that will feature a profile mode,
            showcasing detailed 2D/3D models of objects with interactive hotspots that provide contextual information
            beyond physical display limitations. Another dimension is the network map mode, which can be a dynamic
            visualization showing the connections between objects based on cultural contexts, materials, techniques,
            themes, and geography. And finally, we have a before-and-after demonstration with clear examples showing the
            traditional geographic categorization versus the culturally situated organization.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Partners</h2>
        <p>(TBD)Our main institutional partner is the Detroit Institute of Arts(DIA), and this will provide us with the
            initial data collection from the Asian artworks, and also to get their iterative institutional feedback for
            improvement. Other potential partners would be additional museums, digital libraries, or archives with
            contemporary collections for our network expansion. We would also look into cultural organizations and
            community groups for some authentic contextualization. Also, academic institutions for research validation
            and student engagement. These partnerships would help us gain access to improved contentualization tools and
            leadership in museum decolonization efforts.
