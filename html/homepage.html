    <h1>Welcome to Reframing Collections: From Geographic Generalizations to Cultural Context</h1>
    <p>We can put project description here.</p>
    <p>Reframing Collections addresses a critical gap in how museums present and contextualize their collections. Currently, institutions like the Detroit Institute of Arts organize diverse cultural artifacts under broad geographic categories such as "Asian Art," which homogenizes distinct cultures, materials, time periods, and artistic traditions. This approach removes objects from their specific cultural contexts and reinforces problematic generalizations.
Our project creates a digital tool that enables museums to present their collections through culturally-situated networks that include geographic connections alongside cultural context. Rather than relying solely on broad regional categories like "Asian Art," we connect objects based on materials, themes, techniques, cultural practices, AND meaningful geographic relationships, which should provide visitors with a more nuanced and respectful understanding of artistic traditions that honors both cultural specificity and geographic heritage. This intervention is both educationally significant and serves anti-racist museum practices by moving away from orientalist categorization systems.
This project addresses the urgent need for museums to decolonize their curatorial practices while providing practical implementation guidance for institutional change.</p>
